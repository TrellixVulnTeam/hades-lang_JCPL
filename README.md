# Hades
A systems level programming language that compiles to LLVM

- Easy interop with C
- Generic types
- Strong type safety
- Interfaces (planned)
- Algebraic data types (planned)
- Editor integration including autocompletion and debugger support (planned)


## Why?
Because building compilers is fun.

Also, it is incredibly hard to build compilers and
I learned (still learning really) the hard way. I intend to write detailed documentation
about how to write non toy compilers usnig this as an example.

## What does it look like?
Check the suite directory for a few contrived examples used as an automated test suite. Write documentation later because YOLO.
