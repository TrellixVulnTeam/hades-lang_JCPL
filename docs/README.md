# Hades Language

Hades is a systems programming language that gives you
manual control over memory management, along with modern features
like

- Closures
- Sealed Types (also known as algebraic data types)
- Functions and structs with type parameters
- A powerful trait system that allows constraining type parameters
- Straightforward interop with C libraries
- Source level debugging using GDB/LLDB (works well with Visual Studio Code)
