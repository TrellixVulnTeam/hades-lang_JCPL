# Hades Language
Hades is a modern systems language with a focus on usability, ergonomics, and safety.

It has several modern features

- Sealed Types (also knows as Algebraic data types/ADTs in other languages)
- Closures
- Functions and structs with type parameters
- Constrained type parameters using a powerful trait system
- Extension methods
- Straightforward C library consumption
- Source level debugging using GDB and LLDB (works well with VSCode plugins)

Hades takes inspiration from several modern and old programming languages,
including C++, Rust, Zig, Haskell, and many more.
